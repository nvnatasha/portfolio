      - I'm Natasha! I have been a registered veterinary technician for the last 8 years, which holds a special place in my heart. I'm also a single mom, which was one of the deciding factors for me to make a complete leap of faith in a relatively drastic career switch to become a software engineer. I've always enjoyed puzzles and problem solving and thrive in a field where I can be mentally stimulated. With that being said, that's how I came across the tech industry. My brother and his fiance' both went through Turing to become front-end engineers, and seeing how much they loved it was the part that committed me on this new adventure.
      - I'm excited about the opportunities this field can bring forth for me, with such a wide variety of companies and their impact. Ideally, a dream of mine would to work for a company that's linked to the veterinary industry, since I have so much background knowledge on it already. My hope is to be able to use my prior knowledge to help with efficiency and productivity for the veterinary industry in some way, that way I get the best of both worlds working simultaneously for two fields that I have love for.
